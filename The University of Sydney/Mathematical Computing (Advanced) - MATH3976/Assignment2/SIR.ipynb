We will simplify things as much as possible to get an idea of how things work.\n",

A more nuanced model could consider people who are alive and recovered versus people who die from the infection. The former group may (for example) be able to help others without getting sick again. Another subtlety is that it might take a different amount of time to die than to recover completely. But again, for now, this is only to get you thinking. We'll have plenty to explore with the simplest model. Also, in the case of COVID-19, the **case fatality rate** is large enough to cause the whole world to shut down for multiple months. But it's still small enough that it doesn't affect the overall population level. Of course, this is not always reasonable. The Black Plague killed roughly 50% of Europe between 1346-1353.  \n",
